Hello! I enjoy coding as a hobby and am currently studying Computer Science at university. 

## What I'm doing

### [sukadia.dev](https://sukadia.dev)

As of recent I've been focusing on Discord bot development with [Everyone Votes](https://top.gg/bot/805922495705251891) that you can add to your own servers! I'm also dabbling in website development with [sukadia.dev](https://sukadia.dev). Outside of that, I stream coding and games on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/sukadia) and edit videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Sukadia).

## The Discord Hub

### [sukadia.dev/hub](https://sukadia.dev/hub)

As the name suggests, it's the hub for all of my projects, videos, and streams. If you'd like to keep tabs on any one of these things, I post updates very regularly here! It's also the way to get in direct contact with me.

## Support me

### [sukadia.dev/ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/sukadia/tiers)

On Ko-fi I offer membership tiers (the equivalent of Patreon tiers) that grant access to any secret projects I'm working on and some extra YT content. With support I can continue paying to run my projects 24/7 and gather a lot more motivation to continue what I do.
